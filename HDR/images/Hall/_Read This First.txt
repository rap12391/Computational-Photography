PROCESSING INFORMATION

The images have been pre-processed in the following way: 

The original three RAW files where pre-processed and converted to TIFFs in Adobe Camera RAW (ACR) in the following way:

> The CA (Chromatic Aberration) was removed
> The color temperature (white balance) and tint was set to the same value for all images
> Sharpening and noise reduction was turned off (all sliders to zero)
> The lens distortion was removed based on the built-in profile for the Nikkor lens
> All other settings were kept at their default values

The images where exported from ACR as 8-bit TIFFs, and they were watermarked in Photoshop. 

No additional processing was applied.


PROCESSING TIPS

Use the source images as you feel appropriate. It is not strictly necessary to use all of them. Visit the image page at http://farbspiel-photo.com/view/images/into-the-open-hdr to get information on my personal workflow for this image. It may serve as a starting point.

NOTE: The source images do contain some noise. Noise reduction was turned off in the Raw converter software to give you images that are as unaltered as possible. I recommend that you apply some NR before you merge the images into and HDR or in your HDR software when you're merging them.
